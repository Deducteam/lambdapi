#NAME qualpat.

T : Type.
a : T.

(; Be careful, using identifiers qualified with
   the current module name is very bad practice.
   Two reasons for this: scoping is not yet ok
   with qualified names and scoping, once fixed,
   will fail in this situation.
   This test will be removed in the future. ;)

def f : T -> qualpat.T.
[] f qualpat.a --> a.
