Encoding of arbitrary functional Pure Type Systems after [Embedding
Pure Type Systems in the Lambda-Pi-Calculus
Modulo](http://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-540-73228-0_9), by Denis
Cousineau and Gilles Dowek, TLCA 2007, with some examples: the Thierry
Coquand and GÃ©rard Huet's calculus of constructions, and the PTS with
a predicative infinite hierarchy of sorts underlying the type system
of Agda.
