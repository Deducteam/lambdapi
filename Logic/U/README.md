Theory U
========

Lambdapi formalization of the Theory U introduced in [Axioms for
Mathematics](https://doi.org/10.4230/LIPIcs.FSCD.2021.20), by Frédéric
Blanqui, Gilles Dowek, Emilie Grienenberger, Gabriel Hondet and
François Thiré, FSCD'21.

The theory U is modular: you can build your own sub-logic by only
requiring the files you need. For instance, by requiring Set, Prop,
Quant and Arrow, you get predicate intuitionist higher-order logic. If
you add Impredicativity, you get impredicative intuitionist
higher-order logic. If you add again ProofObj, DepArrow and DepImpl,
you get the calculus of constructions. Etc.
