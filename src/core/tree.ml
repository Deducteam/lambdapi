    based on the method described by Luc Maranget.

(** {1 Types for decision trees}

    The types involved in the definition of decision trees are given in module
    {!module:Tree_types} (they could not be defined here as this would lead to
    a cyclic dependency).

    {b Example:} let us consider the rewrite system for symbol [f] defined as:
    - [f Z     (S m) ↪ S m],
    - [f n     Z     ↪ n] and
    - [f (S n) (S m) ↪ S (S m)].

    A possible decision tree might be
    {v
    ├─?─∘─Z─∘     ↪ n
    ├─Z─∘─Z─∘     ↪ n
    │   └─S─∘─?─∘ ↪ S m
    ├─S─∘─Z─∘     ↪ n
    └─S─∘─?─∘     ↪ S (S m)
    v}
    with [∘] being a node (with an omitted label) and [─u─] being an edge with
    a matching on symbol [u] or a variable or wildcard when [?]. Typically the
    portion [S─∘─Z] is made possible by a swap. *)

type tree = rhs Tree_types.tree

(** {1 Conditions for decision trees}

    The decision trees used for pattern matching include binary nodes carrying
    conditions (see constructor {!constructor:Tree_types.tree.Cond}) that must
    be tested during evaluation to select which of the two subsequent branches
    to follow. There are two forms of conditions:
    - convertibility conditions ({!constructor:Tree_types.tree_cond.CondNL}),
    - free variable conditions ({!constructor:Tree_types.tree_cond.CondFV}).

    Convertibility conditions are used whenever we try to apply a rule that is
    not left-linear, for example [f $x $x (s $y) ↪ r]. In this case we need to
    test whether the two terms at position [{0}] and [{1}] (that correspond to
    pattern variable [$x]) are convertible: the rule may only apply if that is
    the case. Note that in general there may be more than two occurrences of a
    variable, so we may need to check convertibility several times.

    Free variable constraints are used to verify which variables are free in a
    term. If there is a rule of the form [f (λ x y, $Y[y]) ↪ $Y], then we need
    to check that the term at position [{0.0}] does not depend on [x] (or that
    among [x] and [y], only [y] is allowed). *)

(** {1 Clause matrix and pattern matching problem} *)

(** {b NOTE} we ideally need the {!type:stack} of terms used during evaluation
    (argument [stk] of {!val:Eval.tree_walk}) to have fast element access (for
    swaps) as well as fast destruction and reconstruction operations (for more
    information on these operations have a look at  {!val:Extra.List.destruct}
    and {!val:Extra.List.reconstruct}).  These operations are intuitively used
    to inspect a particular element, reduce it, and then reinsert it. It seems
    that in practice,  the naive representation based on lists performs better
    than more elaborate solutions, unless there are rules with many arguments.
    Alternatives to a list-based implementation would be cat-enable lists  (or
    deques), finger trees (Paterson & Hinze) or random access lists.  With the
    current implementation, [destruct e i] has a time complexity of [Θ(i)] and
    [reconstruct l m r] has a time complexity of [Θ(length l + length m)]. *)

(** Clause matrices encode pattern matching problems.  The clause matrix {i C}
    can be denoted {i C = P ↪ A} where {i P} is a {e pattern matrix} and {i A}
    is a column of {e RHS}.  Each line of a matrix is a pattern to which a RHS
    is attached. When reducing a term,  if a line filters the term  (i.e., the
    term matches the pattern) then term is rewritten to the RHS. *)

  type arg =
    { arg_path : int list (** Reversed path to the subterm. *)
    ; arg_rank : int      (** Number of abstractions along the path. *) }

  (** {b NOTE} the {!field:arg_path} describes a path to the represented term.
      The idea is that each index of the list tells under which argument to go
      next (counting from [0]), starting from the end of the list. For example
      let us consider the term [f x (g a b)]. The subterm [a] is accessed with
      the path [[0 ; 1]] (go under the second argument [g a b] first, and then
      take its first argument). Similarly, [b] is encoded as [[1 ; 1]] and [x]
      as [[0]]. Note that a value [[]] does not describe a valid path. Also, a
      [0] index is used when going under abstractions. In that case, the field
      {!field:arg_rank} is incremented. *)

  (** Data used to effectively apply a rule (i.e., substitute terms matching a

(** {b NOTE} {!val:compile} produces a decision tree from a set of rewriting
    rules (in practice, they all belong to a same symbol).  This tree is
    designed to be used in the reduction process, in function
    {!val:Eval.tree_walk}.  The purpose of the trees is to
    - declare efficiently whether the input term (during evaluation) matches
      some LHS from the orginal rules (the one from which the tree is built);
    - build a substitution mapping some (sub) terms of the input term to the
      rewritten term.

    The first bullet is handled by the definition of the trees, e.g. if a
    switch node contains in its mapping a tree constructor [s], then terms
    having (as head structure) symbol [s] will be accepted.

    The second bullet is managed by the environment builder of type
    {!type:CM.env_builder}.  If a LHS contains a named pattern variable, then
    it is used in the RHS.  To do that, the term is saved into an array of
    terms [vars].  When the leaf is reached, the terms from that array are
    copied into the RHS.  The instructions to save terms are in the field
    {!field:CM.store}.  The instructions to copy adequately terms from [vars]
    to the RHS are in an environment builder (of type
    {!type:CM.env_builder}). *)
