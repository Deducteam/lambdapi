(** Signature state.

   This module provides a record type [sig_state] containing all the
   informations needed for scoping p_terms and printing terms, and functions
   on this type for manipulating it. In particular, it provides functions
   [open_sign], [add_symbol], [add_binop], etc. taking a [sig_state] as
   argument and returning a new [sig_state] as result. These functions call
   the corresponding functions of [Sign] which should not be called directly
   but through the current module only, in order to setup the [sig_state]
   properly. *)
