(** The head-structure of a term t is:
- λx:_,h if t=λx:a,u and h is the head-structure of u
- Π if t=Πx:a,u
- h _ if t=uv and h is the head-structure of u
- ? if t=?M[t1,..,tn] (and ?M is not instantiated)
- t itself otherwise (TYPE, KIND, x, f)

A term t is in head-normal form (hnf) if its head-structure is invariant by
reduction.

A term t is in weak head-normal form (whnf) if it is an abstration or if it
is in hnf. In particular, a term in head-normal form is in weak head-normal
form.

A term t is in strong normal form (snf) if it cannot be reduced further.

(** {b NOTE} that in {!val:tree_walk} matching with trees involves two
    collections of terms.
    1. The argument stack [stk] of type {!type:stack} which contains the terms
       that are matched against the decision tree.
    2. An array [vars] containing subterms of the argument stack [stk] that
       are filtered by a pattern variable. These terms may be used for
       non-linearity or free-variable checks, or may be bound in the RHS.

    The [bound] array is similar to the [vars] array except that it is used to
    save terms with free variables. *)

(** {b NOTE} in the {!val:tree_walk} function, bound variables involve three
    elements:
    1. a {!constructor:Term.term.Abst} which introduces the bound variable in
       the term;
    2. a {!constructor:Term.term.Vari} which is the bound variable previously
       introduced;
    3. a {!constructor:Tree_type.TC.t.Vari} which is a simplified
       representation of a variable for trees. *)

(** [tree_walk dt m stk] tries to apply a rewrite rule by matching the stack
   [stk] against the decision tree [dt] using variable definitions in [m]. The
   resulting state of the abstract machine is returned in case of
   success. Even if matching fails, the stack [stk] may be imperatively
   updated since a reduction step taken in elements of the stack is preserved
