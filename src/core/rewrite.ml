(** [eq ctx t u] tests the equality of [t] and [u] (up to α-equivalence).
    It fails if [t] or [u] contain terms of the form [Patt(i,s,e)] or
    [TEnv(te,env)].  In the process, subterms of the form [TRef(r)] in [t] and
    [u] may be set with the corresponding value to enforce equality, and
    variables appearing in [ctx] can be unfolded. In other words, [eq t u] can
    be used to implement non-linear matching. When the
    matching feature is used, one should make sure that [TRef] constructors do
    not appear both in [t] and in [u] at the same time. Indeed, the references
    are set naively, without occurrence checking. *)
