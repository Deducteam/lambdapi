(** Evaluation and conversion.

Preliminary remarks. We define the head-structure of a term t as:
- λx:_,h if t=λx:a,u and h is the head-structure of u
- Π if t=Πx:a,u
- h _ if t=uv and h is the head-structure of u
- ? if t=?M[t1,..,tn] (and ?M is not instantiated)
- t itself otherwise (TYPE, KIND, x, f)

A term t is in head-normal form (hnf) if its head-structure is invariant by
reduction.

A term t is in weak head-normal form (whnf) if it is an abstration or if it
is in hnf. In particular, a term in head-normal form is in weak head-normal
form.

A term t is in strong normal form (snf) if it cannot be reduced further. *)

   state of the abstract machine is returned in case of success. Even if
   matching fails, the stack [stk] may be imperatively updated since a
   reduction step taken in elements of the stack is preserved (this is done
   using [TRef]). Fresh metavariables generated by
   unification rules with extra pattern variables are added in [p]. *)
