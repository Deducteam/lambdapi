    otherwise. *)
let to_tvar : term -> tvar = fun t ->
  match t with Vari(x) -> x | _ -> assert false

(** {b NOTE} the {!val:Array.map to_tvar} function is useful when working
   with multiple binders. For example, this is the case when manipulating
   pattern variables ([Patt] constructor) or metatavariables ([Meta]
   constructor).  Remark that it is important for these constructors to hold
   an array of terms, rather than an array of variables: a variable can only
   be substituted when if it is injected in a term (using the [Vari]
   constructor). *)

(** {b NOTE} the result of {!val:to_tvar} can generally NOT be precomputed. A
    first reason is that we cannot know in advance what variable identifier is
    going to arise when working under binders,  for which fresh variables will
    often be generated. A second reason is that free variables should never be
    “marshaled” (e.g., by the {!module:Sign} module), as this would break the
    freshness invariant of new variables. *)
