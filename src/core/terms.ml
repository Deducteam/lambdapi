(** Term representation.

    This module contains the definition of the core abstract syntax tree (AST)
    of the language, together with smart constructors and low level operation.
    The representation strongly relies on the {!module:Bindlib} library, which
    provides a convenient abstraction to work with binders.

(** {3 Term (and symbol) representation} *)

(** Symbol properties. *)
type prop =
  | Defin
  (** The symbol is definable by rewriting rules. *)
  | Const
  (** The symbol cannot be defined. *)
  | Injec
  (** The symbol is definable but is assumed to be injective. *)

(** Specify the visibility and usability of symbols outside their module. *)
type expo =
  | Public
  (** Visible and usable everywhere. *)
  | Protec
  (** Visible everywhere but usable in LHS arguments only. *)
  | Privat
  (** Not visible and thus not usable. *)

(** Pattern-matching strategy modifiers. *)
type match_strat =
  | Sequen
  (** Rules are processed sequentially: a rule can be applied only if the
      previous ones (in the order of declaration) cannot be. *)
  | Eager
    (** Any rule that filters a term can be applied (even if a rule defined
        earlier filters the term as well). This is the default. *)

(** Representation of a term (or types) in a general sense. Values of the type
    are also used, for example, in the representation of patterns or rewriting
    rules. Specific constructors are included for such applications,  and they
    are considered invalid in unrelated code. *)
type term =
  | Vari of term Bindlib.var
  (** Free variable. *)
  | Type
  (** "TYPE" constant. *)
  | Kind
  (** "KIND" constant. *)
  | Symb of sym
  (** User-defined symbol. *)
  | Prod of term * (term, term) Bindlib.binder
  (** Dependent product. *)
  | Abst of term * (term, term) Bindlib.binder
  (** Abstraction (with domain type). *)
  | Appl of term * term
  (** Term application. *)
  | Meta of meta * term array
  (** Metavariable application (used by unification and for proof goals). *)
  | Patt of int option * string * term array
  (** Pattern variable application (only used in rewriting rules LHS). *)
  | TEnv of term_env * term array
  (** Term environment (only used in rewriting rules RHS). *)
  | Wild
  (** Wildcard (only used for surface matching, never in a LHS). *)
  | TRef of term option ref
  (** Reference cell (only used for surface matching). *)
  | LLet of term * term * (term, term) Bindlib.binder
  (** [LLet(a, t, u)] is [let x : a ≔ t in u] (with [x] bound in [u]). *)

(** {b NOTE} that a wildcard "_" of the concrete (source code) syntax may have
    a different representation depending on the application. For instance, the
    {!constructor:Wild} constructor is only used when matching patterns (e.g.,
    with the "rewrite" tactic). In the LHS of a rewriting {!type:rule}, we use
    the {!constructor:Patt} constructor to represend wildcards of the concrete
    syntax. They are thus considered to be fresh, unused pattern variables. *)

(** Representation of a rewriting rule RHS (or action) as given in the type of
    rewriting rules (see {!field:Terms.rhs}) with the number of variables that
    are not in the LHS. In decision trees, a RHS is stored in every leaf since
    they correspond to matched rules. *)
 and rhs = (term_env, term) Bindlib.mbinder * int

(** Representation of a decision tree (used for rewriting). *)
 and dtree = rhs Tree_types.dtree

(** Representation of a user-defined symbol. Symbols carry a "mode" indicating
    whether they may be given rewriting rules or a definition. Invariants must
    be enforced for "mode" consistency (see {!type:sym_prop}).  *)
 and sym =
  { sym_name  : string
  (** Name of the symbol. *)
  ; sym_type  : term ref
  (** Type of the symbol. *)
  ; sym_path  : Files.Path.t
  (** Module in which it is defined. *)
  ; sym_def   : term option ref
  (** Definition of the symbol. *)
  ; sym_impl  : bool list
  (** Implicitness of the first arguments ([true] meaning implicit). *)
  ; sym_rules : rule list ref
  (** Rewriting rules for the symbol. *)
  ; sym_tree  : dtree ref
  (** Decision tree used for pattern matching against rules of the symbol. *)
  ; sym_prop  : prop
  (** Property of the symbol. *)
  ; sym_expo  : expo
  (** The visibility of the symbol. *)
  ; sym_mstrat: match_strat ref
  (** The reduction strategy modifier. *) }

(** {b NOTE} that {!field:sym_type} holds a (timed) reference for a  technical
    reason related to the writing of signatures as binary files  (in  relation
    to {!val:Sign.link} and {!val:Sign.unlink}).  This is necessary to enforce
    ensure that two identical symbols are always physically equal, even across
    signatures. It should NOT be otherwise mutated. *)

(** {b NOTE} we maintain the invariant that {!field:sym_impl} never ends  with
    [false]. Indeed, this information would be redundant. If a symbol has more
    arguments than there are booleans in the list then the extra arguments are
    all explicit. Finally, note that {!field:sym_impl} is empty if and only if
    the symbol has no implicit parameters. *)

(** {b NOTE} the value of the {!field:sym_prop} field of symbols restricts the
    value of their {!field:sym_def} and {!field:sym_rules} fields. A symbol is
    not allowed to be given rewriting rules (or a definition) when its mode is
    set to {!constructor:Constant}. Moreover, a symbol should not be given at
    the same time a definition (i.e., {!field:sym_def} different from [None])
    and rewriting rules (i.e., {!field:sym_rules} is non-empty). *)

(** {3 Representation of rewriting rules} *)

(** Representation of a rewriting rule. A rewriting rule is mainly formed of a
    LHS (left hand side),  which is the pattern that should be matched for the
    rule to apply, and a RHS (right hand side) giving the action to perform if
    the rule applies. More explanations are given below. *)
 and rule =
  { lhs      : term list
  (** Left hand side (or LHS). *)
  ; rhs      : (term_env, term) Bindlib.mbinder
  (** Right hand side (or RHS). *)
  ; arity    : int
  (** Required number of arguments to be applicable. *)
  ; arities  : int array
  (** Arities of the pattern variables bound in the RHS. *)
  ; vars     : term_env Bindlib.var array
  (** Bindlib variables used to build [rhs]. The last [xvars_nb] variables
      appear only in the RHS *)
  ; xvars_nb : int
  (** Number of variables in RHS but not in LHS. *) }

(** The LHS (or pattern) of a rewriting rule is always formed of a head symbol
    (on which the rule is defined) applied to a list of pattern arguments. The
    list of arguments is given in {!field:lhs},  but the head symbol itself is
    not stored in the rule, since rules are stored in symbols.  In the pattern
    arguments of a LHS, [Patt(i,s,env)] is used to represent pattern variables
    that are identified by a name [s] (unique in a rewriting rule). They carry
    an environment [env] that should only contain distinct variables (terms of
    the form [Vari(x)]).  They correspond to the set of all the variables that
    may appear free in a matched term. The optional integer [i] corresponds to
    the reserved index (if any) for the matched term in the environment of the
    RHS during matching. When [i] is [None], then the variable is not bound in
    the RHS. If it is [Some(_)], then the variables is bound in the RHS, or it
    appears non-linearly in the LHS.

    For instance, with the rule [f $X $Y $Y $Z ↪ $X]:
     - [$X] is represented by [Patt(Some 0, "X", [||])] since it occurs in the
       RHS of the rule (and it is actually the only one),
     - [$Y] is represented by [Patt(Some 1, "Y", [||])] as it occurs more than
       once in the LHS (the rule is non-linear in this variable),
     - [$Z] is represented by [Patt(None, "Z", [||])] since it is only appears
       once in the LHS, and it is not used in the RHS. Note that wildcards (in
       the concrete syntax) are represented in the same way, and with a unique
       name (in the rule) that is generated automatically.

    Then, the term [f t u v w] matches the LHS with a substitution represented
    by an array of terms (or rather “term environments”) [a] of length 2 if we
    have [a.(0) = t], [a.(1) = u] and [a.(1) = v]. *)

(** {b NOTE} that the second parameter of the {!constructor:Patt}  constructor
    holds an array of terms. This is essential for variables binding: using an
    array of variables would NOT suffice. *)

(** {b NOTE} that the value of the {!field:arity} field  (of a rewriting rule)
    gives the number of arguments contained in its LHS. As a consequence,  the
    value of [r.arity] is always equal to [List.length r.lhs] and it gives the
    minimal number of arguments required to match the LHS of the rule. *)

(** The RHS (or action) or a rewriting rule is represented by a term, in which
    (higher-order) variables representing "terms with environments" (see the
    {!type:term_env} type) are bound. To effectively apply the rewriting rule,
    these  bound variables must be substituted using "terms with environments"
    that are constructed when matching the LHS of the rule. *)

(** All variables of rewriting rules that appear in the RHS must appear in the
    LHS. This constraint is checked in {!module:Sr}.In the case of unification
    rules, we allow variables to appear only in the RHS.  In that case, these
    variables are replaced by fresh meta-variables each time the rule is used.
    The last  {!field:terms.rule.xvars} variables of  {!field:terms.rule.vars}
    are such RHS-only variables. *)

(** Representation of a "term with environment", which intuitively corresponds
    to a term with bound variables (or a "higher-order" term) represented with
    the {!constructor:TE_Some} constructor. Other constructors are included so
    that "terms with environments" can be bound in the RHS of rewriting rules.
    This is purely technical. *)
 and term_env =
  | TE_Vari of term_env Bindlib.var
  (** Free "term with environment" variable (used to build a RHS). *)
  | TE_Some of (term, term) Bindlib.mbinder
  (** Actual "term with environment" (used to instantiate a RHS). *)
  | TE_None
  (** Dummy term environment (used during matching). *)

(** The {!constructor:TEnv}[(te,env)] constructor intuitively corresponds to a
    term [te] with free variables together with an explicit environment [env].
    Note that the binding of the environment actually occurs in [te], when the
    constructor is of the form {!constructor:TE_Some}[(b)]. Indeed, [te] holds
    a multiple binder [b] that binds every free variables of the term at once.
    We then apply the substitution by performing a Bindlib substitution of [b]
    with the environment [env]. *)

(** During evaluation, we only try to apply rewriting rules when we reduce the
    application of a symbol [s] to a list of argument [ts]. At this point, the
    symbol [s] contains  every rule [r] that can potentially be applied in its
    {!field:sym_rules} field.  To check if a rule [r] applies,  we  match  the
    elements of [r.lhs] with those of [ts] while building an environment [env]
    of type {!type:term_env array}. During this process, a pattern of the form
    {!constructor:Patt}[(Some i,s,e)] matched against a term [u] will  results
    in [env.(i)] being set to [u]. If all terms of [ts] can be matched against
    corresponding patterns, then environment [env] is fully constructed and it
    can hence be substituted in [r.rhs] with [Bindlib.msubst r.rhs env] to get
    the result of the application of the rule. *)

(** {3 Metavariables and related functions} *)

(** Representation of a metavariable,  which corresponds to a place-holder for
    a (yet unknown) term which free variables are bound by an environment. The
    substitution of the free variables with the environment is suspended until
    the metavariable is instantiated (i.e., set to a particular term).  When a
    metavariable [m] is instantiated,  the suspended substitution is  unlocked
    and terms of the form {!constructor:Meta}[(m,env)] can be unfolded. *)
 and meta =
  { meta_key   : int
  (** Unique key of the metavariable. *)
  ; meta_name  : string option
  (** Optional name. *)
  ; meta_type  : term ref
  (** Type of the metavariable. *)
  ; meta_arity : int
  (** Arity of the metavariable (environment size). *)
  ; meta_value : (term, term) Bindlib.mbinder option ref
  (** Definition of the metavariable, if known. *) }

(** [is_injective s] tells whether the symbol is injective. *)
let is_injective : sym -> bool = fun s -> s.sym_prop = Injec

(** [is_constant s] tells whether the symbol is a constant. *)
let is_constant : sym -> bool = fun s -> s.sym_prop = Const

(** [is_private s] tells whether the symbol [s] is private. *)
let is_private : sym -> bool = fun s -> s.sym_expo = Privat

(** Typing context associating a [Bindlib] variable to a type and possibly a
    definition. *)
type ctxt = (term Bindlib.var * term * term option) list

(** Type of unification constraints. *)
type constr = ctxt * term * term

(** [unfold t] repeatedly unfolds the definition of the surface constructor of
    [t], until a significant {!type:term} constructor is found.  The term that
    is returned cannot be an instantiated metavariable or term environment nor
    a reference cell ({!constructor:TRef} constructor). Note that the returned
    value is physically equal to [t] if no unfolding was performed. *)
let rec unfold : term -> term = fun t ->
  match t with
  | Meta(m, ar)          ->
      begin
        match !(m.meta_value) with
        | None    -> t
        | Some(b) -> unfold (Bindlib.msubst b ar)
      end
  | TEnv(TE_Some(b), ar) -> unfold (Bindlib.msubst b ar)
  | TRef(r)              ->
      begin
        match !r with
        | None    -> t
        | Some(v) -> unfold v
      end
  | _                    -> t

(** {b NOTE} [unfold] could be defined as [Ctxt.unfold []], but since [unfold]
    is critical regarding performance, it is kept as simple as possible. *)

(** {b NOTE} that {!val:unfold} must (almost) always be called before matching
    over a value of type {!type:term}. *)

(** [unset m] returns [true] if [m] is not instantiated. *)
let unset : meta -> bool = fun m -> !(m.meta_value) = None

(** [fresh_meta ?name a n] creates a fresh metavariable with the optional name
    [name], and of type [a] and arity [n]. *)
let fresh_meta : ?name:string -> term -> int -> meta =
  let counter = Stdlib.ref (-1) in
  let fresh_meta ?name a n =
   { meta_key =  Stdlib.(incr counter; !counter) ; meta_name = name
   ; meta_type = ref a ; meta_arity = n ; meta_value = ref None }
  in fresh_meta

(** [set_meta m v] sets the value of the metavariable [m] to [v]. Note that no
    specific check is performed, so this function may lead to cyclic terms. *)
let set_meta : meta -> (term, term) Bindlib.mbinder -> unit = fun m v ->
  m.meta_type := Kind; (* to save memory *) m.meta_value := Some(v)

(** [meta_name m] returns a string representation of [m]. *)
let meta_name : meta -> string = fun m ->
