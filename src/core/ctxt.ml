(** [unbind ctx a def b] returns a triple [(x,t,new_ctx)] such that [(x,t)] is
    an unbinding of [b] (in the sense of [Bindlib.unbind]) and [new_ctx] is an
    extension of context [ctx] with the assumption that [x] has type [a] (only
    if [x] occurs in [t]). If [def] is of the form [Some(u)], the context also
    registers the term [u] as the definition of variable [x]. *)

    appears, and raises [Not_found] otherwise. *)

  List.exists (fun (y,_,_) -> Bindlib.eq_vars x y)

(** [to_prod ctx t] builds a product by abstracting over the context [ctx], in
    the term [t]. It returns the number of products as well. *)

(** [unfold ctx t] behaves like {!val:Term.unfold t} unless term[t] is of the
    form [Vari(x)] with [x] defined in [ctx]. In this case, [t] is replaced by
    the definition of [x] in [ctx].  In particular, if no operation is carried
    out on [t], we have [unfold ctx t == t]. *)

(** [get_args ctx t] decomposes term [t] as {!val:LibTerm.get_args} does, but
    any variable encountered is replaced by its definition in [ctx] (if it
    exists). *)

(** {b NOTE} that both [unfold] and [get_args] redefine the functions in
    {!module:LibTerm} and {!module:Term}. *)
