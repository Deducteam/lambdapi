(** Type for binders, implemented as closures. The bound variables of a
    closure term always refer either to a variable bound by the parent binder
    or to a slot in the closure environment of the parent binder. No direct
    reference to variables bound by an ancestor binder!

    In a binder [(bi,u,e)] of arity [n], [Bvar(InSub i)] occurring in the
    closure term [u] (with [i < n]) refers to the bound variable at position
    [i] in the given substitution (e.g. argument [vs] of msubst), and
    [Bvar(InEnv i)] refers to the term [e.(i)]

    For instance, the term [λx. λy. x y] is represented as
    [Abst(_,(_,Abst(_,(_,Appl(Bvar(InSub 0)|Bvar(InEnv 0)),
                       [|Bvar(InSub 0)|])),

    with the "rewrite" tactic). In the LHS of a rewriting {!type:rule}, we use
    the {!constructor:Patt} constructor to represend wildcards of the concrete
    syntax. They are thus considered to be fresh, unused pattern variables. *)

  ; sym_path  : Path.t (** Module in which the symbol is defined. *)
  ; sym_name  : string (** Name. *)
  ; sym_type  : term Timed.ref (** Type. *)
  ; sym_impl  : bool list (** Implicit arguments ([true] meaning implicit). *)

                                without its definition. *) }

(** {b NOTE} {!field:sym_type} holds a (timed) reference for a  technical
    reason related to the writing of signatures as binary files  (in  relation
    to {!val:Sign.link} and {!val:Sign.unlink}).  This is necessary to
    ensure that two identical symbols are always physically equal, even across
    signatures. It should NOT be otherwise mutated. *)

(** {b NOTE} We maintain the invariant that {!field:sym_impl} never ends  with
    [false]. Indeed, this information would be redundant. If a symbol has more
    arguments than there are booleans in the list then the extra arguments are
    all explicit. Finally, note that {!field:sym_impl} is empty if and only if
    the symbol has no implicit parameters. *)

(** {b NOTE} {!field:sym_prop} restricts the possible
    values of {!field:sym_def} and {!field:sym_rules} fields. A symbol is
    not allowed to be given rewriting rules (or a definition) when its mode is
    set to {!constructor:Constant}. Moreover, a symbol should not be given at
    the same time a definition (i.e., {!field:sym_def} different from [None])
    and rewriting rules (i.e., {!field:sym_rules} is non-empty). *)

(** {b NOTE} For generated symbols (recursors, axioms), {!field:sym_pos} may
   not be valid positions in the source. These virtual positions are however
   important for exporting lambdapi files to other formats. *)

(** {3 Representation of rewriting rules} *)

(** Representation of a rewriting rule. A rewriting rule is mainly formed of a
    LHS (left hand side),  which is the pattern that should be matched for the
    rule to apply, and a RHS (right hand side) giving the action to perform if
    the rule applies. More explanations are given below. *)
 and rule =
  { lhs      : term list (** Left hand side (LHS). *)
  ; names    : string array (** Names of pattern variables. *)
  ; rhs      : term (** Right hand side (RHS). *)
  ; arity    : int (** Required number of arguments to be applicable. *)
  ; arities  : int array
  (** Arities of the pattern variables bound in the RHS. *)
  ; vars_nb  : int (** Number of variables in [lhs]. *)
  ; xvars_nb : int (** Number of variables in [rhs] but not in [lhs]. *)
  ; rule_pos : Pos.popt (** Position of the rule in the source file. *) }

(** {b NOTE} {!field:arity} gives the number of arguments contained in the
   LHS. It is always equal to [List.length r.lhs] and gives the minimal number
   of arguments required to match the LHS. *)

(** {b NOTE} For generated rules, {!field:rule_pos} may not be valid positions
   in the source. These virtual positions are however important for exporting
   lambdapi files to other formats. *)

(** All variables of rewriting rules that appear in the RHS must appear in the
   LHS. In the case of unification rules, we allow variables to appear only in
   the RHS. In that case, these variables are replaced by fresh meta-variables
   each time the rule is used. *)

(** During evaluation, we only try to apply rewriting rules when we reduce the
   application of a symbol [s] to a list of argument [ts]. At this point, the
   symbol [s] contains every rule [r] that can potentially be applied in its
   {!field:sym_rules} field. To check if a rule [r] applies, we match the
   elements of [r.lhs] with those of [ts] while building an environment [env].
   During this process, a pattern of
   the form {!constructor:Patt}[(Some i,_,_)] matched against a term [u] will
   results in [env.(i)] being set to [u]. If all terms of [ts] can be matched
   against corresponding patterns, then environment [env] is fully constructed
   and it can hence be substituted in [r.rhs] with [subst_patt env r.rhs]
   to get the result of the application of the rule. *)

(** {3 Metavariables and related functions} *)

(** Representation of a metavariable,  which corresponds to a yet unknown
    term typable in some context. The substitution of the free variables
    of the context is suspended until the metavariable is instantiated
    (i.e., set to a particular term).  When a metavariable [m] is
    instantiated,  the suspended substitution is  unlocked and terms of
    the form {!constructor:Meta}[(m,env)] can be unfolded. *)
