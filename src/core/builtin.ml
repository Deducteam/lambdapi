   [name] i n the map [map], which should contain all the builtin symbols that
   are in scope. If the symbol cannot be found then [Fatal] is raised. *)

(** [check ss pos name sym] runs the registered check for builtin symbol
   [name] on the symbol [sym] (if such a check has been registered). Note that
   the [bmap] argument is expected to contain the builtin symbols in scope,
   and the [pos] argument is used for error reporting. *)

(** [register name check] registers the checking function [check], for the
   builtin symbols named [name]. When the check is run, [check] receives as
   argument a position for error reporting as well as the map of every builtin
   symbol in scope. It is expected to raise the [Fatal] exception to signal an
   error. Note that this function should not be called using a [name] for
   which a check has already been registered. *)

(** [register_expected_type name build pp] registers a checking function that
   checks the type of a symbol defining the builtin [name] against a type
   constructed using the given [build] function. *)
