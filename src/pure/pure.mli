(** Exception raised by [parse_text]. *)
exception Parse_error of Pos.pos * string

(** [parse_text st ~fname contents] runs the parser on the string [contents]
   as if it were a file named [fname]. The action takes place in the state
   [st], and an updated state is returned. The function may raise
   [Parse_error]. *)

(** [handle_command st cmd] evaluates the command [cmd] in state [st],  giving

    to the [Cmd_OK] constructor,  the command starts a proof (corresponding to
    the [Cmd_Proof] constructor), or the command fails (corresponding  to  the
    [Cmd_Error] constuctor). *)

    a new proof state (with [Tac_OK]) or an error (with [Tac_Error]). *)
val handle_tactic : proof_state -> Tactic.t -> tactic_result

(** [end_proof st] finalises the proof which state is [st], returning a result
    at the command level for the whole theorem. This function should be called
    when all the tactics have been handled with [handle_tactic]. Note that the
    value returned by this function cannot be {!constructor:Cmd_Proof}. *)

    [st]. This can be used for displaying the type of symbols. *)

(** [set_initial_time ()] records the current imperative state as the rollback
    "time" for the [initial_state] function. This is only useful to initialise
    or reinitialise the pure interface. *)
