(** Exception raised in case of failure. Note that we use an optional optional
    source position. [None] is used on errors that are independant from source
    code position (e.g., errors related to command-line arguments parsing). In
    cases where positions are expected [Some None] may be used to indicate the
    abscence of a position. This may happen when terms are generated (e.g., by
    a form of desugaring). *)
exception Fatal of Pos.popt option * string

(** [fatal_str fmt] may be called an arbitrary number of times to build up the
    error message of the [fatal] or [fatal_no_pos] functions prior to  calling
    them. Note that the messages are stored in a buffer that is flushed by the
    [fatal] or [fatal_no_pos] function. Hence, they must be called. *)

    error that has no precise attached source code position. *)

(** [handle_exceptions f] runs [f ()] in an exception handler and handles both
    expected and unexpected exceptions by displaying a graceful error message.
    In case of an error, the program is (irrecoverably) stopped with exit code
    [1] (indicating failure). Hence, [handle_exceptions] should only be called
    by the main program logic, not by the internals. *)
