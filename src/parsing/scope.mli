(** [scope_term ~find_sym ~typ ~mok prv ss env t] turns a pterm [t] into a
    term in the signature state [ss] and environment [env] (for bound
    variables). If [prv] is [true], then the term must not
    contain any private subterms. If [~typ] is [true], then [t] must be
    a type (defaults to [false]). No {b new} metavariables may appear in
    [t], but metavariables in the image of [mok] may be used. The function
    [mok] defaults to the function constant to [None]. The function
    [~find_sym] is used to scope symbol identifiers. *)

(** [scope_search_pattern ~find_sym ~typ prv ss env t] turns a pterm [t] meant
    to be a search patter into a term in the signature state [ss]
    and environment [env] (for bound variables). If [~typ] is [true],
    then [t] must be a type (defaults to [false]). No {b new} metavariables
    may appear in [t], but metavariables in the image of [mok] may be used.
    The function [mok] defaults to the function constant to [None]. The
    function [~find_sym] is used to scope symbol identifiers. *)

(** [scope_rule ~find_sym ur ss r] turns a parser-level rewriting rule [r],
    or a unification rule if [ur] is true, into a pre-rewriting rule.
    The function [~find_sym] is used to scope symbol identifiers. *)

(** [scope_rw_patt ss env t] turns a parser-level rewrite tactic specification
    [s] into an actual rewrite specification (possibly containing variables of
    [env] and using [ss] for aliasing). *)
