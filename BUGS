* Too many results found?

anywhere >= (Π x: _, (= _ V# V#))
anywhere >= (Π x: _, (= _ x x))

* html tags in textual output :-(

* would it be more reasonable to save the normalization rules
  when the index is created and apply them as default when searching,
  in particular when searching as a lambdapi command?

* normalize queries when given as commands in lambdapi

* alignments with same name ==> automatic preference?

* better pagination
