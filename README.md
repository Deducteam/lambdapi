Operating systems
-----------------

Lambdapi requires a Unix-like system. It might be possible to make it work on Windows too with Cygwin or "bash on Windows".

Installation via Opam
---------------------

```bash
opam install lambdapi
```
gives you the command ``lambdapi``.

The [Emacs](https://lambdapi.readthedocs.io/en/latest/emacs.html) extension is available on [MELPA](https://melpa.org/#/lambdapi-mode).

The [VSCode](https://lambdapi.readthedocs.io/en/latest/vscode.html) extension is available on the [Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Deducteam.lambdapi).

To browse the source code documentation, you can do:
```bash
opam install odig
odig doc lambdapi
```

To install Lambdapi libraries, see the [opam-lambdapi-repository](https://github.com/Deducteam/opam-lambdapi-repository).

**Remark:** To install Opam, see [here](https://opam.ocaml.org/).

To make sure that programs installed via opam are in your path, you
should have in your `.bashrc` (or any other shell initial file) the
following line that can be automatically added when you do `opam
init`:

```bash
test -r ~/.opam/opam-init/init.sh && . ~/.opam/opam-init/init.sh > /dev/null 2> /dev/null || true
```

To update your path, you can also do:
```bash
eval `opam env`
```

Compilation from the sources
----------------------------

You can get the sources using `git` as follows:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Deducteam/lambdapi.git
```

Dependencies are described in `lambdapi.opam`. The command `why3
config detect` must be run for Why3 to know the available provers for
the `why3` tactic.

Using Opam, a suitable OCaml environment can be setup as follows:
```bash
cd lambdapi
opam install .
why3 config detect
```

To compile Lambdapi, just run the command `make` in the source directory.
This produces the `_build/install/default/bin/lambdapi` binary.
Use the `--help` option for more information. Other make targets are:

```bash
make                        # Build lambdapi
make doc                    # Build the user documentation (avalaible on readthedocs)
make bnf                    # Build the BNF grammar
make odoc                   # Build the developer documentation
make install                # Install lambdapi
make install_emacs_mode     # Install emacs mode
make install_vim_mode       # Install vim mode
```

You can run `lambdapi` without installing it with `dune exec -- lambdapi`.

For running tests, one also needs
[alcotest](https://github.com/mirage/alcotest) and
[alt-ergo](https://alt-ergo.ocamlpro.com/).

For building the source code documentation, one needs
[odoc](https://github.com/ocaml/odoc). The starting file of the source
code html documentation is
`_build/default/_doc/_html/lambdapi/index.html`.

For building the User Manual, see `doc/README.md`.

The following commands can be used to clean up the repository:
```bash
make clean     # Removes files generated by OCaml.
make distclean # Same as clean, but also removes library checking files.
make fullclean # Same as distclean, but also removes downloaded libraries.
```
