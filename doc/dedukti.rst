Compatibility with Dedukti
==========================

Lambdapi can read `Dedukti
<https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Deducteam/Dedukti/master/syntax.bnf>`__
files with the extension ``.dk``, and translate Lambdapi files to
Dedukti files, and vice versa, by using the command ``export``
:doc:`command <options>`.

Moreover, a Lambdapi file can refer to a symbol declared in a Dedukti file.

In case there are two files ``file.dk`` and ``file.lp``, ``file.lp`` is used.
