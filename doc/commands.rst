Commands
========

The BNF grammar of Lambdapi is in `lambdapi.bnf <https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Deducteam/lambdapi/master/doc/lambdapi.bnf>`__.

Lambdapi files are formed of a list of commands. A command starts with
a particular reserved keyword and ends with a semi-colon.

One-line comments are introduced by ``//``:

::

   // These words are ignored

Multi-line comments are opened with ``/*`` and closed with ``*/``. They can be nested.

::

   /* These
      words are
      ignored /* these ones too */ */

.. _require:

``require``
-----------

Informs the type-checker that the current module
depends on some other module, which must hence be compiled.

A required module can optionally be aliased, in which case it
can be referred to with the provided name.

::

   require std.bool;
   require church.list as list;

Note that ``require`` always take as argument a qualified
identifier. See :doc:`module` for more details.

.. _open:

``open``
--------

Puts into scope the symbols of the previously required module given
in argument. It can also be combined with the ``require`` command.

::

   require std.bool;
   open std.bool;
   require open church.sums;

Note that ``open`` always take as argument a qualified
identifier. See :doc:`module` for more details.

.. _symbol:

``symbol``
----------

Allows to declare or define a symbol as follows:

*modifiers* ``symbol`` *identifier* *parameters* [``:`` *type*] [``≔`` *term*] [``begin`` *proof* ``end``] ``;``

The identifier should not have already been used in the current module.
It must be followed by a type or a definition (or both).

The following proof (if any) allows the user to solve typing and
unification goals the system could not solve automatically. It can
also be used to give a definition interactively (if no defining term
is provided).

Without ``≔``, this is just a symbol declaration. Note that, in this
case, the following proof script does *not* provide a proof of *type*
but help the system solve unification constraints it couldn't solve
automatically for checking the well-sortedness of *type*.

For defining a symbol or proving a theorem, which is the same thing,
``≔`` is mandatory. If no defining *term* is provided, then the
following proof script must indeed include a proof of *type*. Note
that ``symbol f:A ≔ t`` is equivalent to ``symbol f:A ≔ begin refine t
end``.

Examples:

::

   symbol N:TYPE;

   // with no proof script
   symbol add : N → N → N; // a type but no definition (axiom)
   symbol double n ≔ add n n; // no type but a definition
   symbol triple n : N ≔ add n (double n); // a type and a definition

   // with a proof script (theorem or interactive definition)
   symbol F : N → TYPE;
   symbol idF n : F n → F n ≔
   begin
     assume n x; apply x;
   end;

**Modifiers:**

Modifiers are keywords that precede a symbol declaration to provide
the system with additional information on its properties and behavior.

- **Opacity modifier**:

  - ``opaque``: The symbol will never be reduced to its
    definition. This modifier is generally used for actual theorems.

- **Property modifiers** (used by the unification engine or the conversion):

  - ``constant``: No rule or definition can be given to the symbol
  - ``injective``: The symbol can be considered as injective, that is, if ``f t1 .. tn`` ≡ ``f u1 .. un``, then ``t1``\ ≡\ ``u1``, …, ``tn``\ ≡\ ``un``. For the moment, the verification is left to the user.

  - ``commutative``: If a symbol ``f`` is ``commutative`` but not
    ``associative`` then the reduction relation is enriched with the
    following conditional rewriting rule:

    * ``f t u ↪ f u t`` if ``t > u``

    where ``≤`` is a total ordering on terms such that:
    * ``f t₁ t₂ < g u`` iff ``f <ᶠ g``, where ``≤ᶠ`` is a total ordering on function symbols and term constructors left unspecified;
    * ``f t₁ t₂ < f u₁ u₂`` iff ``t₁ < u₁`` or else ``t₁ = u₁`` and ``t₂ < u₂`` (arguments are compare lexicographically from left to right).

  - ``left associative commutative``: In this case, the reduction
    relation is enriched with the following conditional rewriting
    rules:

    * ``f t (f u v) ↪ f (f t u) v``
    * ``f t u ↪ f u t`` if ``t > u``
    * ``f (f t u) v ↪ f (f u t) v`` if ``t > u``

  - ``right associative commutative``: In this case, the reduction
    relation is enriched with the following conditional rewriting
    rules:

    * ``f (f t u) v ↪ f t (f u v)``
    * ``f t u ↪ f u t`` if ``t > u``
    * ``f t (f u v) ↪ f u (f t v)`` if ``t > u``

  This can be used to identify terms modulo the following theories:
  - ACI = AC + Idempotence: `max-suc algebra <https://github.com/Deducteam/lambdapi/blob/master/tests/OK/max-suc-alg.lp>` in the representation of type universe levels
  - AG = AC + Inverse + Neutral: `linear arithmetic <https://github.com/Deducteam/lambdapi/blob/master/tests/OK/lia.lp>`

- **Exposition modifiers** define how a symbol can be used outside the
  module where it is defined. By default, the symbol can be used
  without restriction.

  - ``private``: The symbol cannot be used.
  - ``protected``: The symbol can only be used in left-hand side of
    rewrite rules.

  Exposition modifiers obey the following rules: inside a module,

  - Private symbols cannot appear in the type of public symbols.
  - Private symbols cannot appear in the right-hand side of a
    rewriting rule defining a public symbol.
  - Externally defined protected symbols cannot appear at the head of
    a left-hand side.
  - Externally defined protected symbols cannot appear in the right
    hand side of a rewriting rule.

- **Matching strategy modifier:**

  - ``sequential``: modifies the pattern matching algorithm. By default,
    the order of rule declarations is not taken into account. This
    modifier tells Lambdapi to apply rules defining a sequential symbol
    in the order they have been declared (note that the order of the
    rules may depend on the order of the ``require`` commands). An
    example can be seen in ``tests/OK/rule_order.lp``.
    *WARNING:* using this modifier can break important properties.

Examples:

::

   constant symbol Nat : TYPE;
   constant symbol zero : Nat;
   constant symbol succ (x:Nat) : Nat;
   symbol add : Nat → Nat → Nat;
   opaque symbol add0 n : add n 0 = n ≔ begin ... end; // theorem
   injective symbol double n ≔ add n n;
   constant symbol list : Nat → TYPE;
   constant symbol nil : List zero;
   constant symbol cons : Nat → Π n, List n → List(succ n);
   private symbol aux : Π n, List n → Nat;

**Implicit arguments:** Some arguments can be declared as implicit by
encloding them into square brackets ``[`` … ``]``. Then, they must not
be given by the user later.  Implicit arguments are replaced by ``_``
at parsing time, generating fresh metavariables. An argument declared
as implicit can be explicitly given by enclosing it between square
brackets ``[`` … ``]`` though. If a function symbol is prefixed by
``@`` then the implicit arguments mechanism is disabled and all the
arguments must be explicitly given.

::

   symbol eq [a:U] : T a → T a → Prop;
   // The first argument of "eq" is declared as implicit and must not be given
   // unless "eq" is prefixed by "@".
   // Hence, "eq t u", "eq [_] t u" and "@eq _ t u" are all valid and equivalent.

**Notations**: Some notation can be declared for a symbol using the
commands :ref:`notation` and :ref:`builtin`.

 .. _notation:

``notation``
----------------

The ``notation`` command allows to change the behaviour of the parser.

When declared as notations, identifiers must be used at correct places
and are not valid terms on their own anymore.  To reaccess the value
of the identifier without the notation properties, wrap it in
parentheses like in ``(+)`` if ``+`` is declared ``infix``.

**infix** The following code defines infix symbols for addition
and multiplication. Both are associative to the left, and they have
priority levels ``6`` and ``7`` respectively.

::

   notation + infix left 6;
   notation × infix left 7;

The modifier ``infix``, ``infix right`` and ``infix left`` can be used
to specify whether the defined symbol is non-associative, associative to
the right, or associative to the left.
Priority levels are floating point numbers, hence a
priority can (almost) always be inserted between two different levels.

As explained above, at this point, ``+`` is not a valid term anymore, as it was
declared infix.  The system now expects ``+`` to only appear in expressions of
the form ``x + y`` To get around this, you can use ``(+)`` instead.

**prefix** The following code defines a prefix symbol for
negation with some priority level.

::

   notation ¬ prefix 5;

*Remarks:*

* Prefix and infix operators share the same levels of priority, hence depending
  on the binding power, ``-x + z`` may be parsed ``(-x) + z`` or ``-(x + z)``.

* Non-operator application (such as ``f x`` where ``f`` and ``x`` are not
  operators) has a higher binding power than operator application:
  let ``-`` be a prefix operator, then ``- f x`` is always parsed ``- (f x)``,
  no matter what the binding power of ``-`` is.

* The functional arrow has a lower binding power than any operator, therefore
  for any prefix operator ``-``, ``- A → A`` is always parsed ``(- A) → A``

**quantifier** Allows to write ```f x, t`` instead of ``f (λ x, t)``:

::

   symbol ∀ {a} : (T a → Prop) → Prop;
   notation ∀ quantifier;
   compute λ p, ∀ (λ x:T a, p); // prints `∀ x, p
   type λ p, `∀ x, p; // quantifiers can be written as such
   type λ p, `f x, p; // works as well if f is any symbol

**printing numbers in decimal notation** It is possible to print various number types in decimal notation by defining the following builtins:

* Natural numbers in base 1 (Peano numbers):

::
   
   builtin "nat_zero" ≔ ...; // : N
   builtin "nat_succ" ≔ ...; // : N → N

* Positive natural numbers in base 2:

::
   
   builtin "pos_one" ≔ ...; // : P
   builtin "pos_double" ≔ ...; // : P → P
   builtin "pos_succ_double" ≔ ...; // : P → P

* Integer numbers in base 2:

::
   
   builtin "int_zero" ≔ ...; // : Z
   builtin "int_positive" ≔ ...; // : P → Z
   builtin "int_negative" ≔ ...; // : P → Z

.. _builtin:

``builtin``
---------------

The command ``builtin`` allows to map a “builtin“
string to a user-defined symbol identifier. Those mappings are
necessary for other commands, tactics or notations to work.

.. _opaque:

``opaque``
---------------

The command ``opaque`` allows to set opaque (see **Opacity modifier**) a previously defined symbol.

::

   symbol πᶜ p ≔ π (¬ ¬ p); // interpretation of classical propositions as types
   opaque πᶜ;

.. _rule:

``rule``
--------

Rewriting rules for definable symbols are declared using the ``rule``
command.

::

   rule add zero      $n ↪ $n;
   rule add (succ $n) $m ↪ succ (add $n $m);
   rule mul zero      _  ↪ zero;

Identifiers prefixed by ``$`` are pattern variables.

User-defined rules are assumed to form a confluent (the order of rule
applications is not important) and terminating (there is no infinite
rewrite sequences) rewriting system when combined with β-reduction.

The verification is left to the user, who can call external provers
for trying to check those properties automatically using the
:doc:`command line options <options>` ``--confluence`` and
``--termination``.

Lambdapi will however try to check at each ``rule`` command that the
added rules preserve local confluence, by checking the joinability of
critical pairs between the added rules and the rules already added in
the signature (critical pairs involving AC symbols or non-nullary
pattern variables are currently not checked). A warning is output if
Lambdapi finds a non-joinable critical pair. To avoid such a warning,
it may be useful to declare several rules in the same ``rule`` command
by using the keyword ``with``:

::

   rule add zero      $n ↪ $n
   with add (succ $n) $m ↪ succ (add $n $m);

Rules must also preserve typing (subject-reduction property), that is,
if an instance of a left-hand side has some type, then the
corresponding instance of the right-hand side should have the same
type. Lambdapi implements an algorithm trying to check this property
automatically, and will not accept a rule if it does not pass this
test.

**Higher-order pattern-matching**. Lambdapi allows higher-order
pattern-matching on patterns à la Miller but modulo β-equivalence only
(and not βη).

::

   rule diff (λx, sin $F.[x]) ↪ λx, diff (λx, $F.[x]) x × cos $F.[x];

Patterns can contain abstractions ``λx, _`` and the user may attach an
environment made of *distinct* bound variables to a pattern variable
to indicate which bound variable can occur in the matched term. The
environment is a semicolon-separated list of variables enclosed in
square brackets preceded by a dot: ``.[x;y;...]``. For instance, a
term of the form ``λx y,t`` matches the pattern ``λx y,$F.[x]`` only
if ``y`` does not freely occur in ``t``.

::

   rule lam (λx, app $F.[] x) ↪ $F; // η-reduction

Hence, the rule ``lam (λx, app $F.[] x) ↪ $F`` implements η-reduction
since no valid instance of ``$F`` can contain ``x``.

Pattern variables cannot appear at the head of an application:
``$F.[] x`` is not allowed. The converse ``x $F.[]`` is allowed.

A pattern variable ``$P.[]`` can be shortened to ``$P`` when there is no
ambiguity, i.e. when the variable is not under a binder (unlike in the
rule η above).

It is possible to define an unnamed pattern variable with the syntax
``$_.[x;y]``.

The unnamed pattern variable ``_`` is always the most general: if ``x``
and ``y`` are the only variables in scope, then ``_`` is equivalent to
``$_.[x;y]``.

In rule left-hand sides, λ-expressions cannot have type annotations.

**Important**. In contrast to languages like OCaml, Coq, Agda, etc. rule
left-hand sides can contain defined symbols:

::

   rule add (add x y) z ↪ add x (add y z);

They can overlap:

::

   rule add zero x ↪ x
   with add x zero ↪ x;

And they can be non-linear:

::

   rule minus x x ↪ zero;

Other examples of patterns are available in `patterns.lp <https://github.com/Deducteam/lambdapi/blob/master/tests/OK/patterns.lp>`__.

.. _unif_rule:

``unif_rule``
-----------------

The unification engine can be guided using
*unification rules*. Given a unification problem ``t ≡ u``, if the
engine cannot find a solution, it will try to match the pattern
``t ≡ u`` against the defined rules (modulo commutativity of ≡)
and rewrite the problem to the
right-hand side of the matched rule. Variables of the RHS that do
not appear in the LHS are replaced by fresh metavariables on rule application.

Examples:

::

   unif_rule Bool ≡ T $t ↪ [ $t ≡ bool ];
   unif_rule $x + $y ≡ 0 ↪ [ $x ≡ 0; $y ≡ 0 ];
   unif_rule $a → $b ≡ T $c ↪ [ $a ≡ T $a'; $b ≡ T $b'; $c ≡ arrow $a' $b' ];

Thanks to the first unification rule, a problem ``T ?x ≡ Bool`` is
transformed into ``?x ≡ bool``.

*WARNING* This feature is experimental and there is no sanity check
performed on the rules.

.. _coerce_rule:

``coerce_rule``
---------------

Lambdapi can be instructed to insert function applications into terms whenever
needed for typability. These functions are called *coercions*. For instance,
assuming we have a type ``Float``, a type ``Int`` and a function
``FloatOfInt : Int → Float``, the latter function can be declared
as a coercion from integers to floats with the declaration

::

    coerce_rule coerce Int Float $x ↪ FloatOfInt $x;

Symbol ``coerce`` is a built-in function symbol that computes the coercion.
Whenever a term ``t`` of type ``Int`` is found when Lambadpi expected a
``Float``, ``t`` will be replaced by ``coerce Int Float t`` and reduced.
The declared coercion will allow the latter term to be reduced to
``FloatOfInt t``.

Coercions can call the function ``coerce`` recursively,
which allows to write, e.g.

::

    coerce_rule coerce (List $a) (List $b) $l ↪ map (λ e: El $a, coerce $a $b e) $l;

where ``Set: TYPE;``, ``List : Set → TYPE``, ``El : Set → TYPE`` and ``map`` is
the usual map operator on lists such that ``map f (cons x l) ≡ cons (f x) (map l)``.

*WARNING* Coercions are still experimental and may not mix well with
metavariables. Indeed, the term ``coerce ?1 Float t`` will not reduce to
``FloatOfInt t`` even if the equation ``?1 ≡ Int`` has been registered during
typing. Furthermore, for the moment, it is unsafe to have symbols that can be
reduced to protected symbols in the right-hand side of coercions:
reduction may occur during coercion elaboration,
which may generate unsound protected symbols.

.. _inductive:

``inductive``
-------------

The commands ``symbol`` and ``rules`` above are enough to define
inductive types, their constructors, their induction
principles/recursors and their defining rules.

We however provide a command ``inductive`` for automatically
generating the induction principles and their rules from an inductive
type definition, assuming that the following builtins are defined:

::

   ￼builtin "Prop" ≔ ...; // : TYPE, for the type of propositions
   ￼builtin "P"    ≔ ...; // : Prop → TYPE, interpretation of propositions as types

An inductive type can have 0 or more constructors.

The name of the induction principle is ``ind_`` followed by the name
of the type.

The command currently supports parametrized mutually defined dependent
strictly-positive data types only. As usual, polymorphic types can be
encoded by defining a type ``Set`` and a function ``τ:Set → TYPE``.

Example:

::

   ￼inductive ℕ : TYPE ≔
   ￼| zero: ℕ
   ￼| succ: ℕ → ℕ;

is equivalent to:

::

   ￼constant symbol ℕ : TYPE;
   ￼constant symbol zero : ℕ;
   ￼constant symbol succ : ℕ → ℕ;
   ￼symbol ind_ℕ p : π(p zero) → (Π x, π(p x) → π(p(succ x))) → Π x, π(p x);
   ￼rule ind_ℕ _ $pz _ zero ↪ $pz
   ￼with ind_ℕ $p $pz $ps (succ $n) ↪ $ps $n (ind_ℕ $p $pz $ps $n);

For mutually defined inductive types, one needs to use the ``with``
keyword to link all inductive types together.

Inductive definitions can also be parametrized as follows:

::

   (a:Set) inductive T: TYPE ≔
   | node: τ a → F a → T a
   with F: TYPE ≔
   | nilF: F a
   | consF: T a → F a → F a;

Note that parameters are set as implicit in the types of
constructors. So, one has to write ``consF t l`` or ``@consF a t l``.

For mutually defined inductive types, an induction principle is
generated for each inductive type:

::

   assert ⊢ ind_F: Π a, Π p:T a → Prop, Π q:F a → Prop,
     (Π x l, π(q l) → π(p (node x l))) →
     π(q nilF) →
     (Π t, π(p t) → Π l, π(q l) → π(q (consF t l))) →
     Π l, π(q l);
   assert ⊢ ind_T: Π a, Π p:T a → Prop, Π q:F a → Prop,
     (Π x, Π l, π(q l) → π(p (node x l))) →
     π(q nilF) →
     (Π t, π(p t) → Π l, π(q l) → π(q (consF t l))) →
     Π t, π(p t);

Finaly, here is an example of strictly-positive inductive type:

::

   inductive 𝕆:TYPE ≔ z:𝕆 | s:𝕆 → 𝕆 | l:(ℕ → 𝕆) → 𝕆;

   assert ⊢ ind_𝕆: Π p, π (p z) → (Π x, π (p x) → π (p (s x)))
     → (Π x, (Π y, π (p (x y))) → π (p (l x))) → Π x, π (p x);

   assert p a b c ⊢ ind_𝕆 p a b c z ≡ a;
   assert p a b c x ⊢ ind_𝕆 p a b c (s x) ≡ b x (ind_𝕆 p a b c x);
   assert p a b c x y ⊢ ind_𝕆 p a b c (l x) ≡ c x (λ y, ind_𝕆 p a b c (x y));
