Profiling
=========

This document explains the use of standard profiling tools for the
development of ``lambdapi``.

Using Linux ``perf``
--------------------

The quickest way to obtain a per-symbol execution time is ``perf``. It
is simple to use, provided that you have the right privileges on your
machine. No change is required in the build procedure, but ``lambdapi``
must be invoked as follows.

.. code:: bash

   dune exec -- perf record lambdapi [LAMBDAPI_OPTIONS]

The program behaves as usual, but a trace is recorded in file
``perf.data``. The data can then be displayed with the following
command.

.. code:: bash

   perf report

Profiling using Gprof
---------------------

The ``gprof`` tool can be used to obtain a more precise (and thorough)
execution trace. However, it requires modifying the ``src/dune`` file by
replacing

::

   (executable
    (name lambdapi)

with the following.

::

   (executable
    (name lambdapi)
    (ocamlopt_flags (:standard -p))

This effectively adds the ``-p`` flag to every invocation of
``ocamlopt``.

After doing that, ``lambdapi`` can be launched on the desired example,
to record an execution trace. This has the (side-)effect of producing a
``gmon.out`` file. To retrieve the data, the following command can then
be used.

.. code:: bash

   gprof _build/install/default/lambdapi gmon.out > profile.txt

It takes two arguments: the path to the ``lambdapi`` binary used to
generate the profiling data, and the profiling data itself.
