#### Goals display in Emacs (2020-07-06)

#### Sequential symbol (2020-07-06)

##### Added
- `sequential` keyword for symbol declarations

##### Removed
- `--keep-rule-order` option

#### Change semantics of environments (2020-06-10)

- `$F` is shorthand for `$F[]`
- Empty environment mandatory under binders

#### Add tactic `fail` (2020-05-26)

#### Matching on products (2020-05-18)

Allow users to match on product `Πx: t, u` and on the domain of binders.

#### Quantifier parsing and pretty-printing (2020-05-08)

- Allow users to declare a symbol [f] as quantifier. Then, [f x,t]
  stands for [f(λx,t)].

#### Unification rules (2020-04-29)

Introduction of unification rules, taken from
<http://www.cs.unibo.it/~asperti/PAPERS/tphol09.pdf>.
A unification rule can be set with
```
set unif_rule t ≡ u ↪ v ≡ w, x ≡ y
```

#### Pretty-printing (2020-04-25)

- Pretty-printing hints managed in signature state now.

#### Syntax change (2020-04-16)

- `→` is replaced by `↪` in rewriting rules,
- `&` is replaced by `$` for pattern variables in rewriting rules,
- the syntax `rule ... and ...` becomes `rule ... with ...`,
- `⇒` is replaced by `→` for implication, and
- `∀` is replaced by `Π` for the dependent product type

#### Let bindings (2020-03-31)

Adding let-bindings to the terms structure.
 - Contexts can now contain term definitions.
 - Unification is carried out with a context.
 - Reduction functions (`whnf`, `hnf`, `snf` &c.) are called with a context.
 - Type annotation for `let` in the concrete syntax.

#### Prepare for modern versions of OCaml (2020-03-26)

- Use `Stdlib` instead of `Pervasives` (enforced by sanity checks).
- Rely on `stdlib-shims` to provide `Stdlib` on older version of OCaml.

#### File management and module mapping (2020-03-20)

- New module system.
- Revised command line arguments parsing and introduce subcommands.
- LSP server is now a Lambdapi subcommand: run with `lambdapi lsp`.
- New `--no-warning` option (fixes #296).

#### Trees simplification (2019-12-05)

Simplification of the decision tree structure
 - trees do not depend on term variables;
 - tree constructor type depends on generated at compile-time
   branch-wise unique integral identifiers;
 - graph output is more consistent: variables are the same in the
   nodes and the leaves.
   
#### Protected symbols (2019-11-14)

Introducing protected and private symbols.

#### Calling provers with Why3 (2019-10-29)

Introducing the `why3` tactic to call external provers.

#### Eta equality as a flag (2019-10-21)

#### Rewriting using decision trees (2019-09-17)
