  LSP server

#### Record metavariable creation and instantiation during scoping, type inference and unification (2021-05-20)

- the record type problem gets a new field metas, and all its fields are now mutable
- many functions now take as argument a problem
- the functions infer_noexn, check_noexn and check_sort are moved to Query
  (they do not need to take a solver as argument anymore)
- in Unif, add_constr was defined twice; this is now fixed
- the modules Meta in Term and LibTerm are moved to the new file libMeta

- Fixed scoping of product in LHS
- Wildcard created during tree compilation are the most general ones, any free 
  variable may appear.
- Updated documentation of decision trees

#### Factorize type `rw_patt` (2021-04-07)

The types `Term.rw_patt` and `Syntax.p_rw_patt_aux` are merged into a
single polymorphic type `Syntax.rw_patt`.

#### API modification (2021-04-07)

Several functions are exposed,

- `Parsing.Scope.rule_of_pre_rule`: converts a pre rewriting rule into a 
  rewriting rule,
- `Handle.Command.handle`: now processes proof data,
- `Handle.Command.get_proof_data`: is the old handle,
- `Handle.Compile.compile_with`: allows to provide a command handler to compile
  modules

#### Add commutative and associative-commutative symbols (2021-04-07)

- Add `term.mli` and turn the `term` type into a *private* type so that
  term constructors are not exported anymore (they are available for
  pattern-matching though). For constructing terms, one now needs to
  use the provided construction functions `mk_Vari` for `Vari`,
  `mk_Appl` for `Appl`, etc.

- Move some functions `LibTerm` to `Term`, in particular `get_args`,
  `add_args` and `cmp_term`.

- Rename the field `sym_tree` into `sym_dtree`.

- Redefine the type `rhs` as `(term_env, term) Bindlib.mbinder`
  instead of `(term_env, term) Bindlib.mbinder * int` so that the old
  `rhs` needs to be replaced by `rhs * int` in a few places.

#### Improvements in some tactics (2021-04-05)

- fix `have`
- improve the behavior of `apply`
- `assume` not needed before `reflexivity` anymore
- `assume` checks that identifiers are distinct
- `solve`: simplify goals afterwards

- `syntax`: add `check_notin` and `check_distinct`
- split `misc/listings.tex` into `misc/lambdapi.tex` and `misc/example.tex`

#### Extend command `inductive` to strictly-positive inductive types (2021-04-02)

#### Renamings (2021-04-01)

- `./tools/` -> `./misc`
- `./src/core/tree_types.ml` -> `./src/core/tree_type.ml`

#### Do not unescape identifiers anymore, and move `scope.ml` from `Core` to `Parsing` (2021-03-30)

- escaped regular identifiers are automatically unescaped in lexing
- unescaping is done in filenames only
- `Escape.add_prefix` and `Escape.add_suffix` allow to correctly extend potentially escaped identifiers
- move `scope.ml` from `Core` to `Parsing`

#### Forbid bound variable names ending with a positive integer with leading zeros since there are not compatible with Bindlib (2021-03-29)

#### Fix #341: remove spurious warnings on bound variables (2021-03-29)

* `scope.ml`:
  - the inner functions of scope are brought to the top-level
  - `scope_term_with_params` is introduced: it is similar to `scope_term` but does not check that top-level bound variables are used
  - `_Meta_Type` is moved to `env.ml` as `fresh_meta_type`

* `command.ml`:
  - use `scope_term_with_params` and check that parameters are indeed used
  - `get_implicitness` moved to `syntax.ml` as `get_impl_term`
  - fix implicit arguments computation in case of no type by introducing `Syntax.get_impl_params_list`

* in various places: use `pp_var` instead of `Bindlib.name_of`

* replace expo argument in scoping and handling by boolean telling if private symbols are allowed

* allow private symbols in queries

#### Introduce `new_tvar = Bindlib.new_var mkfree` (2021-03-26)

#### Add tactic `generalize`, and rename tactic `simpl` into `simplify` (2021-03-25)

#### Use Dune for opam integration (2021-03-25)

- Content of `lambdapi.opam` is moved to `dune-project` and the former is
  generated using `dune build @install`.
- Vim files are installed in `opam` prefix using dune.
- The emacs mode is declared as a sub-package.

#### Add tactic `have` (2021-03-24)

#### Compatibility with Why3 1.4.0

#### Add tactic `simpl <id>` for unfolding a specific symbol only (2021-03-22)

and slightly improve `Ctxt.def_of`

#### Bug fixes (2021-03-22)

- fix type inference in the case of an application (t u) where the type of t is not a product yet (uncomment code commented in #596)
- fix the order in which emacs prints hypotheses
- fix opam dependencies: add constraint why3 <= 1.3.3

#### Fix and improve inverse image computation (2021-03-16)

- fix and improve in `inverse.ml` the computation of the inverse image of a term wrt an injective function (no unification rule is needed anymore in common examples, fix #342)
- fix management of "initial" constraints in unification (initial is now a global variable updated whenever a new constraint is added)
- when applying a unification rule, add constraints on types too (fix #466)
- turn `Infer.make_prod` into `Infer.set_to_prod`
- add pp_constrs for printing lists of constraints
- make time printing optional
- improve visualization of debugging data using colors:
  . blue: top-level type inference/checking
  . magenta: new constraint
  . green: constraint to solve
  . yellow: data from signature or context
  . red: instantiations (and handled commands)

#### Add tactic admit (2021-03-12)

- rename command `admit` into `admitted`
- `admitted`: admit the initial goal instead of the remaining goals (when the proof is an opaque definition)
- move code on `admit` from `command.ml` to `tactic.ml`
- add tactic `admit` (fix #380)
  As a consequence, tactics can change the signature state now.

#### Improvements in type inference, unification and printing (2021-03-11)

- improve type inference and unification
- add flag `"print_meta_args"`
- print metavariables unescaped, add parentheses in domains
- replace `(current_sign()).sign_path` by `current_path()`
- improve logging:
  . debug +h now prints data on type inference/checking
  . provide time of type inference/checking and constraint solving
  . give more feedback when instantiation fails

#### Remove `set` keyword (2021-03-04)

#### Various bug fixes (2021-03-02)

- allow matching on abstraction/product type annotations (fix #573)

- fix parsing and printing of unification rules
- Extra.files returns only the files that satisfy some user-defined condition
- tests/ok_ko.ml: test only .dk and .lp files

- Electric mode for Emacs
- Buttons for Proof Navigation in Emacs
- Navigate by commands/tactics in Emacs and VScode
- Evaluated region shrinks on edit in Emacs and VScode
- Evaluated region changes colour after error in Emacs and VScode
- LSP server sends logs only from last command/tactic
- Few minor corrections in LSP server

  (factorizes some code in `scope.ml` and `tactics.ml`)
- add fields in type `Sign.inductive` renamed into `ind_data`

- File renamings and splittings:
  * `lpLexer` -> `escape`, `lpLexer`
  * `console` -> `base`, `extra`, `debug`, `error`, `console`
  * `module` -> `filename`, `path`, `library`

  * `init_cmd` -> `init`

- Improve handling of escaped identifiers in `escape.ml` and fix printing

- Improve `tests/ok_ko.ml` to allow sub-directories in `tests/OK/` or `tests/KO/`

#### File renamings and source code segmentation (2021-02-08)

- File renamings:
  * `terms` -> `term`
  * `basics` -> `libTerm`
  * `tactics` -> `tactic`
  * `queries` -> `query`
  * `stubs` -> `realpath`
  * `files` -> `module`
  * `handle` -> `command`

- `Core` library divided into the following sub-libraries: 
  * `Common` that contains shared basic files
    (`pos`, `console`, `module` and `package`)
  * `Parsing` that contains everything related to parsing
    (`syntax`, `pretty`, lexers and parser)
  * `Handle` that uses `Core` to type check commands and modules 
    (contains `query`, `tactic`, `command`, `compile`, `inductive`, `rewrite`,
    `proof` and `why3_tactic`)
  * `Tool` that provides miscellaneous tools that use `Core`
    (`external`, `hrs`, `xtc`, `tree_graphviz`, `sr`)

#### Add parameters to inductive definitions (2021-02-02)

#### Parser (2021-01-30)

Replace Earley by Menhir, Pratter and Sedlex

Syntax modifications:

- Add multi-lines comments `/*` ... `*/`.

- Commands and tactics must now be ended by a semi-colon `;`.

- The syntax `λx y z: nat, ...` with multiple variables is not
  authorised anymore, but `λ(x y z: nat), ...` is, as well as `λ x :
  N, t` with a single variable.

- In unification rules, the right hand-side must now be enclosed between square brackets, so
  ```
  set unif_rule $x + $y ≡ 0 ↪ $x ≡ 0; $y ≡ 0
  ```
  becomes
  ```
  set unif_rule $x + $y ≡ 0 ↪ [ $x ≡ 0; $y ≡ 0 ];
  ```
- `set declared` has been removed.

- Any (depending on accepted codepoints) UTF8 identifier is by default
  valid.
  *Warning:* string `λx` is now a valid identifier. Hence, expression `λx, t`
  isn't valid, but `λ x, t` is.

- Declared quantifiers now need a backquote to be applied. The syntax 
  `` `f x, t`` represents `f (λ x, t)` (and a fortiori `f {T} (λ x, t)`).

- `assert` always takes a turnstile (or vdash) to specify a (even
  empty) context, so the syntax is `assert ⊢ t: A;`

- The minus sign `-` in the rewrite tactic has been replaced by the
  keyword `left`.

Code modifications:

- Parsing and handling are interleaved (except in the LSP server): the
  parser returns a stream of parsed commands. Requesting an item of
  the stream parses one command in the file.
  
- The type `pp_hint` is renamed to `notation` and moved to `sign.ml`.
  
- Notations (that is, ex-`pp_hint`) are kept in a `SymMap`, which allowed to
  simplify some code in `sig_state.ml` and `sign.ml`.
  
- Positions are not lazy anymore, because Sedlex doesn't use lazy positions.

- `p_terms` do not have `P_BinO` and `P_UnaO` constructors anymore.

#### Trees simplification (2019-12-05)

Simplification of the decision tree structure
 - trees do not depend on term variables;
 - tree constructor type depends on generated at compile-time
   branch-wise unique integral identifiers;
 - graph output is more consistent: variables are the same in the
   nodes and the leaves.
