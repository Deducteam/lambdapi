Proof tactics
=============

The ``symbol`` command allows the user to enter an interactive mode to
solve typing goals (find a term of a given type) and unification goals
(prove that two terms are equivalent). In a typing goal, the term to
find is materialized by a metavariable. The following tactics help
users to refine typing goals and transform unification goals step by
step. A tactic application may generate new
goals/metavariables. Except for the ``solve`` tactic which applies to
all the unification goals at once, all the tactics applies to the
first goal only, which is called the *focused* goal. One can change
the focus goal by using the ``focus`` tactic. The proof is complete
only when all generated goals have been solved.

Reminder: the BNF grammar of tactics is in :download:`syntax.bnf`.

``solve``
---------

Simplify unification goals as much as possible.

``assume``
----------

The tactic ``assume h1 .. hn`` replaces the focused goal of type ``Πx1 .. xn,T``
by a goal of type ``T`` with ``xi`` replaced by ``hi``.

``simpl``
---------

Normalizes the focused goal with respect to β-reduction and the
user-defined rewriting rules.

``refine``
----------

The tactic ``refine t`` tries to instantiate the focused goal by the
term ``t``. ``t`` can contain references to other goals by using ``?n``
where ``n`` is a goal name. ``t`` can contain
underscores ``_`` or new metavariable names ``?n`` which will be
replaced by new metavariables. The unification and type-checking
algorithms will then try to instantiate some of the generated
metavariables. The metavariables that cannot be solved are added as new
goals.

``apply``
---------

The tactic ``apply t`` replaces a goal of type ``T`` by possibly new
goals: ``?0`` of type ``TO``, …, ``?n`` of type ``Tn`` if ``t`` is of
type ``Πx1:T1,..,Πxn:Tn,?0`` and ``t ?1 .. ?n`` is of type ``T``.

``why3``
--------

The tactic ``why3`` calls a prover (using the why3 platform) to solve
the current goal. The user can specify the prover in two ways :

* globally by using the command ``set prover`` described in :doc:`queries`

* locally by the tactic ``why3 "<prover_name>"`` if the user wants to change the
  prover inside an interactive mode.

If no prover name is given, then the globally set prover is used
(``Alt-Ergo`` by default).

A set of symbols should be defined in order to use the ``why3`` tactic.
The user should define those symbols using builtins as follows :

::

   set builtin "T"     ≔ T       // : U → TYPE
   set builtin "P"     ≔ P       // : Prop → TYPE
   set builtin "bot"   ≔ bot     // : Prop
   set builtin "top"   ≔ top     // : Prop
   set builtin "imp"   ≔ imp     // : Prop → Prop → Prop
   set builtin "and"   ≔ {|and|} // : Prop → Prop → Prop
   set builtin "or"    ≔ or      // : Prop → Prop → Prop
   set builtin "not"   ≔ not     // : Prop → Prop

**Important note:** you must run ``why3 config --full-config`` to make
Why3 know about the available provers.

Tactics on equality
-------------------

The tactics ``reflexivity``, ``symmetry`` and ``rewrite`` assume the
existence of terms with approriate types mapped to the builtins ``T``,
``P``, ``eq``, ``eqind`` and ``refl`` thanks to the following builtin
declarations:

::

   set builtin "T"     ≔ ... // : U → TYPE
   set builtin "P"     ≔ ... // : Prop → TYPE
   set builtin "eq"    ≔ ... // : Π {a}, T a → T a → Prop
   set infix ... "="   ≔ eq  // optional
   set builtin "refl"  ≔ ... // : Π {a} (x:T a), P (x=x)
   set builtin "eqind" ≔ ... // : Π {a} x y, P (x=y) → Π p:T a→Prop, P (p y) → P (p x)

``reflexivity``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Solves a goal of the form ``P (t = u)`` when ``t ≡ u``.

``symmetry``
^^^^^^^^^^^^

Replaces a goal of the form ``P (t = u)`` by the goal ``P (u = t)``.

``rewrite``
^^^^^^^^^^^

The ``rewrite`` tactic takes as argument a term ``t`` of type
``Πx1 .. xn,P(l=r)`` prefixed by an optional ``-`` (to indicate that the
equation should be used from right to left) and an optional rewrite
pattern in square brackets, following the syntax and semantics of
SSReflect rewrite patterns:

::

   <rw_patt> ::=
     | <term>
     | "in" <term>
     | "in" <ident> "in" <term>
     | <ident> "in" <term>
     | <term> "in" <ident> "in" <term>
     | <term> "as" <ident> "in" <term>

See `A Small Scale Reflection Extension for the Coq
system <http://hal.inria.fr/inria-00258384>`_, by Georges Gonthier,
Assia Mahboubi and Enrico Tassi, INRIA Research Report 6455, 2016,
section 8, p. 48, for more details.

In particular, if ``u`` is a subterm of the focused goal matching ``l``,
that is, of the form ``l`` with ``x1`` replaced by ``u1``, …, ``xn``
replaced by ``un``, then the tactic ``rewrite t`` replaces in the
focused goal all occurrences of ``u`` by the term ``r`` with ``x1``
replaced by ``u1``, …, ``xn`` replaced by ``un``.

Proof mode management
---------------------

``end``
^^^^^^^

Allows one to quit the proof mode when all goals have been solved. It
then adds in the environment the symbol the proof is about.

``admit``
^^^^^^^^^

Allows one to quit the proof mode even if all goals have not been
solved. It then adds in the environment a new symbol (axiom) whose
type is given by the ``symbol`` command.

``abort``
^^^^^^^^^

Allows one to quit the proof mode without changing the environment.

``focus``
^^^^^^^^^

Allows the user to change the focus to another goal. A goal is
identified by its number in the list of goals displayed by the
``print`` command.

``fail``
^^^^^^^^

Always fails. It is useful when developing a proof to stop at some
particular point.
