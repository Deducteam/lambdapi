Lambdapi User Manual
====================

Lambdapi is a proof assistant based on the λΠ-calculus modulo
rewriting, mostly compatible with the type checker `Dedukti
<https://github.com/Deducteam/dedukti>`__. Lambdapi files must end
with `.lp`. But Lambdapi can also read Dedukti files ending with `.dk`
and convert them to Lambdapi files.

For installation instructions, see `README
<https://github.com/Deducteam/lambdapi/blob/master/README.md>`__.
