What is Lambdapi?
=================

The Lambdapi system is several things. It extends `Dedukti`_ with new
features, especially interactive proof development.

A logical framework
-------------------

The core theoretical system of Lambdapi is a logical framework based on the
λΠ-calculus modulo rewriting. It is hence a dependent type theory that is very
similar to Martin-Lőf’s dependent type theory (i.e., it is an extension of the
simply-typed λ-calculus), but it has the peculiarity of allowing the user to
define functions and types with rewriting rules. Although the system
seems to be very simple at first, it is surprisingly powerful. In particular,
it allows the encoding of the theories behind Coq or HOL.

A tool for interoperability of proof systems
--------------------------------------------

The ability to encode several rather different systems make of Lambdapi an
ideal target for proof interoperability. Indeed, one can for example export a
proof written in `Matita`_ (an implementation of the calculus of inductive
constructions) to the `OpenTheory`_ format (shared between several
implementations of HOL).

An interactive proof system
---------------------------

Being aimed at interoperability, Dedukti was never intended to become a tool
for writing proofs directly. On the contrary, Lambdapi is aimed at providing
an interactive proof mechanism, while remaining compatible with ``Dedukti``
(and its interoperability capabilities).

Here is a list of new features brought by Lambdapi:
- a new syntax suitable for proof developments (including tactics),
- support for unicode (UTF-8) and (user-defined) infix operators,
- automatic resolution of dependencies,
- a simpler, more reliable and fully documented implementation,
- more reliable operations on binders thanks to the Bindlib library,
- a general notion of metavariables, useful for implicit arguments and goals.

An experimental proof system
----------------------------

Finally, let us note that Lambdapi is to be considered (at least for now) as
an experimental proof system based on the λΠ-calculus modulo rewriting. It is
aimed at exploring (and experimenting with) the many possibilities offered by
rewriting, and the associated notion of conversion. In particular, it leads to
simpler proofs, where many details are delegated to the conversion rule.
