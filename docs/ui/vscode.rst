`VSCode`_
=========

Lambdapi provides an extension for VSCode editing (>= 1.37) . The
extension was developed from a bare-bones LSP template, as lambdapi
implements the LSP standard more or less to the letter, but includes
some extra features to handle proofs and goals. To install it from the
``lambdapi`` repository do:

.. code:: bash

   make vscode

This requires to have ``npm`` and ``node-typescript`` installed:

.. code:: bash

   sudo apt install npm node-typescript

*note*: as of today the vscode mode requires a full lambdapi install, it
won‚Äôt unfortunately run from a developer tree.

*note*: The install script will create a link from
``~/.vscode/extensions/lp-vscode`` to the lambdapi tree, you can
override link location [for example for ``vscodium``] by setting the
``LP-VSCODE`` environment variable, i.e. ``make
LP-VSCODE="~/.vscodium/extensions/lp-vscode"``.

Overview
--------

This extension provides syntax highlighting, unicode characters easy
insertion and proof navigation as in CoqIde or ProofGeneral.

It is still under development, thus might be incomplete and buggy.

Features
--------

Proof navigation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Goals are visualised in a panel on the right side of the editor.

* You can navigate the proof with `keybindings <#keybindings>`__.
* ‚ÄúCursor mode‚Äù can be toggled to navigate the proof with the cursor, using `Ctrl+Alt+c`. Other keybindings are still available in this mode.

Hover and definition
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Hovering a token will display its type if available. The "Go to
definition" command is available, you can either :

* press `F12` when your cursor is within the range of a certain symbol
* `right-click` on the symbol -> "Go to definition". It is advised to
  set up a keybinding for "Go Back" in File -> Preferences -> Keyboard
  shortcuts.

Snippets
^^^^^^^^

Type one of the suggested snippets described below, then press Enter
or Tab to confirm adding the chosen Unicode character.

Greek letters
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

For any letter ``l``, typing ```l`` will suggest a corresponding unicode greek
letter (for instance ```b`` will suggest Œ≤). Some greek letters are present in a
‚Äúvar‚Äù form as in LaTeX, accessible with ```vl`` (for instance, ```f`` will
suggest œï and ```vf`` will suggest œÜ).

Fonts
^^^^^

For any letter ``l``, the following prefixes change the font of ``l``
(for instance, ```dN`` is double struck ``N``, ‚Ñï):

* ```dl``: double-struck (‚Ñï)
* ```il``: italic (ùëÅ)
* ```Il``: bold italic (ùëµ)
* ```sl``: script (ùí© )
* ```Sl``: bold script (ùìù)
* ```fl``: Fraktur (ùîë)

Common symbols
""""""""""""""

- ```or`` : ‚à®
- ```and`` : ‚àß
- ```not`` : ¬¨
- ```ra``: ‚Üí
- ```re``: ‚Ü™
- ```is``: ‚âî
- ```eq``: ‚â°
- ```th``: ‚ä¢
- ```all``: ‚àÄ
- ```ex``: ‚àÉ
- ```imp``: ‚áí
- ```box``: ‚ñ°
- ```cons``: ‚∏¨

Recommended extension
---------------------

`This
extension <https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=GuidoTapia2.unicode-math-vscode>`__
allows for replacing ``\->`` with ‚Üí, ``\_1`` with the index ‚ÇÅ and many other
unicode characters by simply pressing Tab.

Troubleshoot
------------

If snippet completion does not seem to work with the VS-Code Lambdapi
Extension or the recommended extension, try pressing ``Ctrl+Space`` to
see completion suggestions.

Outline
-------

The outline of the document with its user-defined symbols is available with :

1. ``Ctrl+Shift+E`` (or clicking on the ``explorer`` in left side-bar)
2. Clicking ``outline`` in the bottom left corner.

Keybindings
-----------

For proof navigation :

-  ``Ctrl+Right`` : go one step forward
-  ``Ctrl+Left`` : go one step backward
-  ``Ctrl+Up`` : go to the previous proof (or the beginning)
-  ``Ctrl+Down`` : go to the next proof (or the end)
-  ``Ctrl+Enter`` : go to the position of the cursor
-  ``Ctrl+Alt+c`` : toggle cursor mode (proof highlight follows the
   cursor or not)
-  ``Ctrl+Alt+w`` : toggle follow mode (proof highlight is always
   centered in the window when keybindings are pressed)
-  ``Shift+Alt+w`` : center proof highlight in the current window

Commands
--------

Proof navigation is also accessible via the command search bar
(``Ctrl+Shift+P``) and searching ‚ÄúLambdapi‚Äù.

A command to restart the Lambdapi VS Code mode is available (can be
useful in case of bugs).

Hover
-----

Hovering symbols provides their type. This feature is still
experimental.

Logs
----

Logs are displayed in a terminal which opens automatically
when needed.
