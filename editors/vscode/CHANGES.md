## [0.2.2]
- code refactoring of the client for maintenability.
- fix the bug that causes the proof navigation to malfunction when the `Goals` panel is closed by the user. Now the panel is recreated whenever needed. If focus is taken away frol the `Goals` panel, focus is given back to it when user starts navigating proofs again.
- fix bug related to navigating sub-goals : navigating next subgoal stops before `{` instead of after it so that next subgoal is correctly shown in the `Goals` panel.
- change navigation with ``navigate until cursor`` : Navigation includes the command if the cursor is whithin its range instead of the line above. 
- first command is no more systematically navigated. If the current command is the first one, navigating the previous command results in no command being navigated.
