Emacs:

- add shortcut C-c C-r for eglot-reconnect

- When doing C-c C-c on a comment, expand the green until this comment (and not until the following command).

- Do not change the green zone and the goals when editing or adding a comment in the green zone.

- Add buttons for forward/backward navigation.

- Print error messages in the log buffer.

- I remarked that clicking on a symbol, say f, prints its type in the bottom line of emacs with fully qualified names only, hence not like if we used a command like 'print f;' at the position of the cursor. So, where this type come from? What arguments are used to get it? Note that VSCode gets it right on hover.

- Instead of printing the type on the bottom line of emacs, would it be possible to print it in a hover like it is done when there is an error?


VSCode:

- Do not change the green zone and the goals when editing or adding a comment in the green zone.

- Add an electric mode in VSCode too.
