- Do not change the green zone and the goals when editing or adding a comment in the green zone.

- Instead of printing the type on the bottom line of emacs, would it be possible to print it in a hover like it is done when there is an error?


VSCode:

- Add an electric mode in VSCode too.

- Do not change the green zone and the goals when editing or adding a comment in the green zone.
